		<h1>Why Music?</h1>
		<p>
			From a young age, Comrade Kartoshkin was raised on a steady diet of classical music,
			taking piano lessons and playing in the school band.
			However, along the way, a lost young Slav discovered hardbass, which ignited a passion in his stagnant heart
			and transformed him into hardworking comrade he is today.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nowdays, Slav spends his free time listening to video game soundtracks and singing along with old Russian and Soviet songs.
