		<h1>Why Become a Programmer?</h1>
		<p>
			From a young age, Slav was always interested in learning more about the world and the limitless potential
			of computers. Thus, he wanted to harness technology to help people learn and bring others together. Science
			is not just about boring formulas and equations but dreaming visions for a better future for all humankind.
			Programming, and video games, can be the ultimate display of creativity, as you are only limited by your imagination.
		</p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>
			In his free time, Slav has been creating on a 2D game engine from scratch: Mayonez Engine, the ultimate
			Slavic engine. This years-long undertaking has been an enormous learning experience for Slav. Slav has also
			decided that his work should be viewable and modifiable by all people for free, so he has hosted it on a 
			<a href="https://github.com/SlavSquatSuperstar/mayonez-engine-2d/">Github repository</a>
			(free and open source forever!).
