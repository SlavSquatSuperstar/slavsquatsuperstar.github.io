		<h1>Inside Slav's Mind</h1>

		<h2>Do You Want to Build a World?</h2>
        <p>
            Since childhood, Slav has always been fascinated with studying the Solar System and beyond.
            Thus he naturally gravitated towards science fiction franchises such as Star Wars and Star Trek.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, Slav discovered the concept of worldbuilding, or creating one's own fictional setting.
            With his imagination and love for sci-fi, Slav hopes to create a realistic depiction of humanity's
            future in space and eventually a video game from his universe. View his progress here on
