		<h1>Why Music?</h1>
		<p>
			From a young age, Comrade Kartoshkin was well-versed in classical music, taking piano lessons, singing in a choir,
			and playing in the school band. Along the way, a young Slav also discovered the magic of hardbass, which ignited a passion
			to seek new types of music. Thanks to the power of song, he transformed into the hardworking comrade he is today.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nowdays, Slav spends his free time listening to video game soundtracks and singing along with old Soviet and Slavic songs.
